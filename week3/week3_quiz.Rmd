# Week 3 Quiz
## Question 1
```{r}
library(datasets)
data(iris)
?iris
str(iris)
mean(iris$Sepal.Length[iris$Species == "virginica"])
```

## Question 2
```{r}
apply(iris[, 1:4], 2, mean)
```

## Question 3
```{r}
library(datasets)
data(mtcars)
?mtcars
str(mtcars)
tapply(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$cyl, mean)
```

## Question 4
First we split gross horse power based on numbers of cylinders:
```{r}
s <- split(mtcars$hp,mtcars$cyl)
s
```
The average horsepower of 4-cylinder cars:
```{r}
avg1 <- mean(s$'4')
```
The average horsepower of 8-cylinder cars:
```{r}
avg2 <- mean(s$'8')
```
The absolute difference between the average horsepower of 4-cylinder cars 
and the average horsepower of 8-cylinder cars is:
```{r}
abs(avg1-avg2)
```

## Question 5
```{r}
debug(ls)
```
Execution of 'ls' will suspend at the beginning of the function and
