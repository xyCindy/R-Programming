# Week 4 Quiz
## Question 1
What is produced at the end of this snippet of R code?
```{r}
set.seed(1)
rpois(5, 2)
```
Solution: A vector with the numbers 1, 1, 2, 4, 1

## Question 2
What R function can be used to generate standard Normal random variables?  
Solution:rnorm

## Question 3
When simulating data, why is using the set.seed() function important?  
Solution:It ensures that the sequence of random numbers starts in a specific 
place and is therefore reproducible

## Question 4
Which function can be used to evaluate the inverse cumulative distribution 
function for the Poisson distribution?    
Solution:qpois

## Question 5
What does the following code do?  
```{r}
set.seed(10)
x <- rep(0:1, each = 5)
e <- rnorm(10, 0, 20)
y <- 0.5 + 2 * x + e
plot(x,y)
``` 

Solution:Generate data from a Normal linear model

## Question 6
What R function can be used to generate Binomial random variables?  
Solution:rbinom

## Question 7
What aspect of the R runtime does the profiler keep track of when an R 
expression is evaluated?  
Solution:the function call stack

## Question 8
Consider the following R code  
library(datasets)  
Rprof()  
fit <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2)  
Rprof(NULL)    
Solution:100%

## Question 9
When using 'system.time()', what is the user time?    
Solution:It is the time spent by the CPU evaluating an expression

## Question 10
If a computer has more than one available processor and R is able to take 
advantage of that, then which of the following is true when using 
'system.time()'?    
Solution:elapsed time may be smaller than user time
